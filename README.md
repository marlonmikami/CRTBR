The Wii and PS2 can be connected to the CRT Monitor using a Component to VGA adapter. This one I've got allows you to switch between scaling resolutions (starting at 480p itself) and aspect ratios, and it also allows for picture adjustments.
You can find Component to VGA adapters on [Aliexpress](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005002393774648.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000060.1.cc6a72a4Lg4Y9k&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller&scm=1007.13339.291025.0&scm_id=1007.13339.291025.0&scm-url=1007.13339.291025.0&pvid=8be36fc2-dae1-4634-a140-6ffe1f39f0dd&_t=gps-id%3ApcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller%2Cscm-url%3A1007.13339.291025.0%2Cpvid%3A8be36fc2-dae1-4634-a140-6ffe1f39f0dd%2Ctpp_buckets%3A668%232846%238116%232002&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000020523449551%22%2C%22sceneId%22%3A%223339%22%7D&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21BRL%21430.93%21258.55%21%21%21%21%21%402101f6b116747343014295494ed6a9%2112000020523449551%21rec&gatewayAdapt=glo2bra) (Not recommending this seller, this is just the first one I've found that looks just like the converter I have)
